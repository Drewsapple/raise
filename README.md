# Raise
A simple crowdfunding DApp, developed for 0xHack. (It's my first one!)

## Pitch Video
[![Pitch Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/pfIPt60Xjdc/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfIPt60Xjdc)

This project was made with the help of [Ramp](ramp.network) and [useDapp](usedapp.io). (It competed for bounties using each of these tools)

You can view the live version of the website [here on Netlify](0xraise.netlify.com).

## Future Work
 - Change Campaign contracts to EIP-1167 compliant base contract with shim proxies to reduce gas cost
 - Move website contents to IPFS, and set up a subgraph to replace faunaDB to become part of the permanant web
 - Add support for markdown-style descriptions, with image support
 - Add DAI and maybe a few other ERC-20 tokens (fewer is better, and minimizes confusion/clutter)
